# Mindplane - EEG Controlled Arcade Game

![Mindplane Logo](mindplane_logo.png)

## Overview

Mindplane is an arcade game that lets you control a plane's position using EEG signals from the Muse 2 headband. Fly the plane through a star-filled sky while navigating obstacles and collecting stars to increase your score. The game provides an immersive experience by translating your brain activity into real-time gameplay.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [muselsl library](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl) running in the background (`muselsl stream`)
- Muse 2 headband
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)
- Paho MQTT library (`pip install paho-mqtt`)

## Setup

1. Connect your Muse 2 headband and make sure the [muselsl library](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl) is running in the background by executing the command `muselsl stream`.

2. Clone or download the Mindplane repository to your local machine.

3. Install the required Python libraries using the following command: pip install pygame paho-mqtt

4. Run the game by executing the `mindplane.py` script:
python mindplane.py


## How to Play

- Use your brain's EEG signals to control the plane's position.
- Calibrate the game by following the on-screen instructions to determine the minimum and maximum EEG signal values.
- Avoid obstacles and collect stars to increase your score.
- Use the "Up" arrow key to increase acceleration and the "Down" arrow key to decrease acceleration.
- The game runs for a total of 120 seconds. Try to achieve the highest score before time runs out!
